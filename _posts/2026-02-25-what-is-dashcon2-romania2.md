### What IS _DashCon 2: Romania_?

_DashCon 2: Romania_ is a convention dedicated to all things fandom and to the beautiful fans that make up said fandoms!

_DashCon_ was the name of the **infamous** 2014 tumblr convention. A memorable time in fandom history marked by the famed ball pit they had at the event.
Now, _DashCon **2**_ is a wonderful and magical re-invention of the old event organized by a whole new team of people, unaffiliated with the original team, who took it upon themselves to bring to fruition the full potential of what _DashCon_ can be.

We've been so inspired by their achievements, _and wanted so badly to have an excuse to buy a big ball pit_, that we've asked them if we can try our hand at a small little off-shoot version of the event here in Romania! 

...**They actually replied!** And even graciously gave us their blessing to have a go at it!


#### We're beyond ourselves with excitement to announce it for you all: **_DashCon 2: Romania_**!


_Now_, I mean it when I said _little version_. We're nowhere near the scale of _DashCon 2_ as we're a small team supporting all the costs ourselves and with this being our first go at a convention, we're aiming small, learning from the [mistakes of the past](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/77/DashCon_Ball_Pit.jpg).


Our event will take place on the **21st of November 2026** at the **Pullman Hotel** in **Bucharest**.

The event will last for _one day_, from HOUR to HOUR and we've got the following activities planned:

... and _yes_! We'll have a ball pit.
