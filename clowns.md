*She/Her | Balloon Artist*

Măriuca is your classic Party Clown with a bubbly and colourful personality, a chronic need for attention and a confident mischievous streak. She can usually be found hiding around the corner, ready to either spook you or dazzle you with her balloon creations, just to keep you on your toes! When she’s not out making friends and falling for scams she’s either crafting a contraption or drawing fanart of her favourite characters kissing. Despite being born in Transilvania, she denies the vampire allegations.
